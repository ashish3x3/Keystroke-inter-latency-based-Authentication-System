Keystroke-inter-latency-based-Authentication-System
===================================================

This application is currently under redesign because of some bugs created by side effects  Mobile user Authentication System based on inter latency and holding period of each succesive password key press   inter latency is time elapsed between pressing succesive keys  holding time is the time period you hold a particular key ( i.e key down-key up )  eg. If your password is "RAME" and during password creation you entered in following way:     Pressed R for 2 sec A for 3 sec and ME back to back  This application authenticats user not only by password matching but also by the pattern in which the password was enterd  Advantages :  password breaching is minimzed as the pattern of entering password  is harder to obtain than mere password  possible next generation authentication system
