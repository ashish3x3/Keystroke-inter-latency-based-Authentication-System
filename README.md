# ****Keystroke-inter-latency-based-Authentication-System****

**### Note: This application is currently under redesign because of some bugs created by side effects** 

_Mobile user Authentication System based on inter latency and holding period of each successive password key press_ 

_inter latency is time elapsed between pressing successive keys holding time is the time period you hold a particular key ( i.e key down-key up )_ 

**eg.** If your password is "RAME" and during password creation you entered in following way: 

Pressed R for 2 sec A for 3 sec and ME back to back This application authenticates user not only by password matching but also by the pattern in which the password was entered 

## Advantages :
* password breaching is minimized as the pattern of entering password is harder to obtain than mere password  
* possible next generation authentication system
